    <div class="static">
        <h1>Static</h1>
        <b>static</b>is the default value. An element with the <i>position</i> <b>static;</b> is not positioned in any special way. A <b>static</b> element is said to be NOT postioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.
    </div> 

    <div class="relative-one">
        <h1>Relative</h1>
        <b>relative</b> behaves the same as <b>static</b> UNLESS you add some extra properties. Such as <i>top, right, bottom, left</i> 

    </div>

    <div class="relative-two">
        Setting the <i>top ,right, bottom, and left</i> properties of a <b>relatively-positioned</b> element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
    </div> 

    <div class="absolute">
        <b>absolute is the trickiest position value. absolute behaves like <i>fixed</i> except <i>relative</i> to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. If an absolutely-positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and still moves along with page scrolling. Remember, a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.</b>
        <h1>absolute</h1>
            This element is <b>absolutely-positioned</b>. It's positioned <b>relative</b> to its parent.
    </div> 

    <div class="fixed">
        <b>A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used. </b>

        <h1> fixed </h1>

        A <b>fixed</b> element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.
    </div>
